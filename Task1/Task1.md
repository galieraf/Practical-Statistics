# Semester Project: Data Analysis from Eurostat
The aim of the first semester project is to analyze data provided by Eurostat. The dataset in question is:

- ID: crim_gen_reg
- Title: Police-recorded offences by NUTS 3 regions
- URL: Eurostat Data
- You will focus on data from a specific European country assigned to you. The data:

Represents the number of criminal offences in the regions of the given country according to the NUTS 3 administrative division.
Covers various categories of criminal offences.
Pertains to the year 2021 (or another year if NA values are present).
Below are three tasks with their respective point values. Full points are awarded for work that is flawless in terms of calculations, formulations, and interpretation of results. The graphical quality of the work is also reflected in the point valuation.

## Task 1
10 points: Perform basic statistical investigations:

Briefly describe the examined data.
Determine the most important statistical measures that best characterize the data.
Represent the data appropriately using selected graphs.
## Task 2
5 points: Create a contingency table of the number of criminal offences in various categories and NUTS 3 areas. Interpret this table, propose hypotheses about its properties, and conduct the appropriate test. Interpret its results.

## Task 3
3x5 points: Based on the nature of the examined data, propose three pairs of ( $H_0$ and $H_A$ )potentially interesting hypotheses leading to three different statistical tests (other than in Task 2):

Hypotheses can be constructed with respect to specific data, but it is also appropriate to consider information from, for example, a European framework or from other years.
Explain which tests you have chosen and why.
Conduct the hypothesis tests and interpret their results both mathematically and practically.
